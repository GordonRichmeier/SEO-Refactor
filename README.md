# SEO-Refactor
optimizing accessibility for horiseon

On this page I attempted to add semantic tags and other elements to clean up the code and optimize SEO and accessibility.
I wanted to make sure foremost that all images contained an alt tag.
Second I wanted to clean up the semantics of the page.
Third I wanted to apply proper comments to the CSS page.
Lastly, I added a more in depth title and meta description.

I think the goal was accomplished however there were things I definitley struggled with.
When attempting to clean up the CSS page, every time I tried to make sure that classes and ID's were being used right
(Classes for multi use customization and ID's for singular use)
the page would break down entirely and it is something I need to keep working on
The semantic hierarchy such as "div" "body" and "main" was a mess but I believe I cleaned it up. However I know it is not perfect.
